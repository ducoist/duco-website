Likes and comments are just the surface. True brand performance hides in deeper signals.

At Duco İstanbul, we track the metrics most brands overlook.

##### 1. Saves

If someone saves your post, it means they saw value. This is a signal of content utility and potential shareability.

##### 2. DM Replies

Private replies = trust. If people are messaging you based on a story or post, you're building true connection.

##### 3. Profile Clicks

Curiosity is a strong indicator. When someone clicks your profile after seeing your content, they're considering your brand.

##### 4. Completion Rate (Video / Story)

How many people watch until the end? Drop-off shows friction. Completion shows resonance.

##### 5. Website Clicks vs Landing Page Behavior

High clicks but high bounce? Misaligned messaging. Low clicks but high conversion? Niche but qualified.
