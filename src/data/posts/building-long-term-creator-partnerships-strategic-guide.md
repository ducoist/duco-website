One-off influencer posts are forgettable. Long-term creator relationships? They build equity.

At Duco İstanbul, we approach creators as brand collaborators, not just placements.

##### 1. Think Beyond Campaigns

Instead of "one and done," build multi-phase plans:

- Pre-launch teasing
- Launch-day amplification
- Post-launch user content

##### 2. Involve Creators Early

Bring them into product testing, naming, co-creation. When influencers feel invested, their content feels authentic.

##### 3. Measure Brand Equity, Not Just ROI

Track growth in:

- Brand sentiment
- Branded search volume
- Earned content reuse

This is harder to measure—but more valuable long-term.

##### 4. Create a Creator Playbook

Include:

- Brand voice
- Visual guidelines
- Do's and Don'ts

Make it feel like onboarding, not control.

**Great creator relationships are built on trust, clarity, and shared goals.**
