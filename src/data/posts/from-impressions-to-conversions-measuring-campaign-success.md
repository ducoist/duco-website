You launched the campaign. It looked great. It got shared. But... did it actually work?

At Duco İstanbul, we believe beautiful marketing must also be measurable marketing. And that requires moving beyond surface metrics to focus on outcomes that matter—like engagement, behavior, and business impact.

Here's how we track success from the first impression to the final conversion.

##### 1. Impressions & Reach: The Starting Point

These numbers tell you how many people saw your message. Impressions measure total views (including repeats), while reach reflects unique users.

- **Useful for:** Awareness campaigns
- **Limitations:** Doesn't prove interest or action
- **Watch for:** High impressions but low engagement = wrong audience or weak creative

##### 2. Engagement: The First Signal of Interest

Engagement includes likes, comments, shares, clicks, saves—anything that shows the user interacted with your content.

- **Why it matters:** It's the first sign your message resonated.
- **What to track:** Engagement rate (interactions ÷ reach), saves vs shares, click-through rate (CTR)
- **Tip:** Context matters. A 3% engagement rate might be great on one platform, poor on another.

##### 3. Behavior: What Happens After the Click

This is where we leave vanity metrics behind. What did users do after engaging?

- Time on site
- Bounce rate
- Scroll depth
- Page flow
- Funnel progression

These tell you whether users found what they expected—and if your content journey was strong enough to keep them.

##### 4. Conversions: The KPI That Counts

Whether it's signups, sales, bookings, downloads, or inquiries—this is where your campaign justifies itself.

- Use UTM tags to track campaign-specific results
- Align conversion goals with funnel stage (don't expect purchases from awareness ads)
- Set up custom events in GA4 or Meta Ads Manager to track micro and macro conversions

##### 5. Attribution: What Gets the Credit?

Often, users don't convert on the first touch. They might see a story, read a blog, and come back via Google search a week later.

- Use multi-touch attribution models (linear, time decay, data-driven)
- Don't overcredit "last click" behavior
- Analyze conversion paths, not just final steps

**A great campaign doesn't just create impressions—it creates momentum. And momentum is measurable when your metrics match your message.**
