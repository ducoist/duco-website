In a world saturated with sponsored posts, nano-influencers are winning—because they're trusted, relatable, and real.

At Duco İstanbul, we work with nano and micro-influencers not because they're cheap—but because they convert.

##### 1. Higher Engagement Rates

Nano-influencers (1K–10K followers) often see 5–9% engagement. Why?

- They respond to comments
- Their audience feels like a community
- Their content isn't overly polished

##### 2. Stronger Trust Factor

Nano-creators are seen as peers, not celebrities.

- Recommendations feel organic
- Followers believe they're using the product by choice

##### 3. Local Impact

For geo-targeted campaigns, nano-creators have the edge.

- They reach niche, local, or community-specific audiences
- They're great for brand activations, events, and hyper-local content

##### 4. Cost Efficiency + Results

Instead of spending €20,000 on one mega-post, you can activate 50 nano-creators with tailored briefs, hitting multiple segments with authenticity.

**Real impact isn't always loud. Sometimes, it's intimate.**
