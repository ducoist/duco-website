Influencer marketing isn't about chasing big names—it's about finding the right voices. The ones your audience already trusts.

At Duco İstanbul, we take influencer matchmaking seriously. Here's how we evaluate creators beyond vanity metrics:

##### 1. Engagement > Follower Count

A 10K creator with 8% engagement is more valuable than a 100K account with 0.4%. Look at:

- Likes, comments, saves, shares
- Comment quality (real vs bots)
- Story views & replies

##### 2. Audience Fit

Are their followers your audience?

- Look at follower geos, age ranges, and interests
- Use tools like HypeAuditor or Modash
- Avoid creators whose audience is unrelated or fake

##### 3. Brand Alignment

Would they use your product without a payment?

- Is their tone consistent with yours?
- Would your brand look credible on their feed?

Authenticity beats reach, every time.

##### 4. Past Collaborations & Professionalism

- How do they disclose sponsored content?
- Are they collaborative in co-creation?
- Do they meet deadlines and follow briefs?

**The right influencer is a creative partner, not a content slot.**
